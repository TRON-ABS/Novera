# fix(web): record the public release and follow shared version facts

Novera Web 1.0.1 is deployed at `/Novera/web/` from commit 9ec7c5efea4ae669af74082466588399e397970d. Record the successful deployment, 757 public file hash comparisons, actual short text generation and conversation persistence after reload. Preserve the experimental media, Wan, audit and Pages cache limitations; no full upgrade or Desktop performance parity is claimed.

Remove hardcoded 1.0.1 values from Web staging and showcase/README publishing so the next coordinated release follows the application version and shared release facts. README generation remains idempotent.

Validation: ten distribution/publication tests pass. The deployed code is unchanged by this documentation/staging follow-up; the public runtime remains the exact verified #53/#54 build. The real six-GiB image timeout is recorded as a failed test, with no claimed speed improvement.
